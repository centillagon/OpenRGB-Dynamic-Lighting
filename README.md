Using Python and OpenRGB, there is a simpler way to match your devices colors to your screen. The executable likely works on Windows 7 and above. (Native support for Windows 11)

Tutorial:

1. Install OpenRGB, Download it here: https://openrgb.org/#downloads

2. Enable SDK Server:
Launch **OpenRGB**, go to **SDK Server**, hit **Start Server**, click **Settings**, check "*Minimize on Close*", and close OpenRGB.

3. Run the executable called "main.exe" and let it run in the background while you play your games! (no performance decrease, as it's very lightweight)
4. If you don't want the .exe, run the .py (if you have Python installed on your computer, it REQUIRES version 3.11.9 and you have to download the requirements via requirements.txt)
